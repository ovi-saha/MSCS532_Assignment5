# MSCS532_Assignment5
This repo is assignment 5 for MSCS532 (Algorithm and Data Structure) course.
For this assignment, run the **det_quick_sort first, then analyze it with various types of arrays by inputting the data. Then, run **rand_quick_sort.py** separately and test it with the different array types using user input. User can choose how they want their array. Then, compare the time with the output. From this assignment, I have found that mostly **det_quick_sort** takes less time than **rand_quick_sort**, but for a few cases, like repeated and already sorted arrays, det_quick_sort takes more time compared to the other array types in det_qick_sort. The time difference is greater than that of the randomized quick sort because, for the random selection of the pivot, the time complexity on average is O(n log n), which is a randomized quick sort.
**Assignment5.pdf** is the detailed analysis report for this assignment.
